// MongoDB Playground
// Use Ctrl+Space inside a snippet or a string literal to trigger completions.

const database = 'test';
const collection = 'Employees';

// The current database to use.
use(database);

// 2.Create a collection of your choosing. Something that stores data that is interesting to you. Mine is Employees.
db.createCollection(collection);

// Demonstrate a mongoDB command that lets you enter 3 documents into the collection at once. Include an Id for each document. For my audiobook collection I can save the audiobook titile, the author, the duration in minutes to listen to the audiobook, the narrator, the publisher and the date published.  That is 7 key value pairs. Then to prove this is not a relational database I can include in one of the documents something that is not in the other documents â€“ the genre of Science Fiction for example.
